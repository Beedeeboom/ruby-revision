# Define a hash with two keys, one for a first name, and the other for a last name, and give them the value of nil. 
# Create a method that takes a hash as an argument, along with two string arguments, one for first name and one for last name. 
# In the method, assign the first name argument to the hashâ€™s first name key, and assign the last name argument to the last name key of the hash. 
# Return the hash after these assignments. Call this method with the hash you created earlier, and store the result in a well named variable.
